# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network

## Summary
 This small project implements a feed forward neural network from scratch for a binary classification problem. The network is built by defining classes for Inputs, Neural Units, Loss, and constructing the network. The code is designed to be transparent, allowing for clear understanding of how the network utilizes methods like forward pass,backpropagation and updates the weights accordingly.

## Uses
You can use this notebook to see the underlying processes behind a simple feed forward neural network.
At the end you can easily define your own model and plot your results.
